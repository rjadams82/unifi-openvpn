## Setup unifi gateway openvpn site to site

Here are basic instructions for establishing an openvpn tunnel between a Unifi gateway (like USG or UDM) and an OpenVPN device. In this scenario I am using openWRT.





### Troubleshooting commands

show ip route

show interfaces openvpn detail 

show openvpn status site-to-site

reset openvpn interface vtun65
